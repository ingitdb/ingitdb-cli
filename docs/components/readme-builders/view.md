# 📘 Record View README Builder

Record READMEs are automatically generated materialized views for individual collection records.

They are generated when running `ingitdb docs update` or `ingitdb materialize view` depending on the configuration.

_This document is a placeholder and will be expanded with the format for record-level README documentation._
